These are just a few simple yet powerful privacy and quality of life extensions I always recommend.

1. uBlock Origin- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/
2. I Still Don't Care About Cookies- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/
3. Dark reader- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/
4. Bitwarden- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/
5. Vimium- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/

PS: Feel free to add whichever extensions you want since everyone has a different use case. 
But as a general rule of thumb, try to keep it minimal and only install extensions you know 
you can trust.
