These are just a few simple yet powerful privacy and quality of life extensions I like add to my firefox.

1. uBlock Origin- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/
2. Canvas Blocker- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/
3. Dark reader- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/
4. Bitwarden(Optional)- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/
5. Vimium- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/

PS: Feel free to add whichever extensions you want sice everyone has a different use case. 
But as a general rule of thumb, try to keep it minimal and only install extensions you know 
you can trust.
