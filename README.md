# About
    This is my personal user.js file for Firefox. Although firefox is still an open-source browser,
    its parent company, Mozilla, has continually made bade decision after bad decision, 
    resulting in it's overall decline in market share. One of Firefox's biggest problems for regular users is its built in telemetry and unnecessary features.
    Still to this day though, some privacy conscious individuals choose to use Firefox over anything based on chromium to fight against Google's overall web monopoly
    (even in the smallest ways). Several conscious minded individuals have tried to fix this by writing several user.js files that can 
    change any setting in Firefox to be more private. This one is no different, it's the one that works perfectly for me to enjoy online privacy while being usable. 
    It is a fork of the betterfox user.js but it restores things I need like DRM and it doesn't delete all browsing history on close.

# Recommended Extensions
    I also keep a list of a handful of quality-of-life and privacy extensions I like using on my browser.
    They can be found in this repo.
